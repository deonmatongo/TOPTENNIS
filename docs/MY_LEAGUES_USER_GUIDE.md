# 🎾 My Leagues - A User's Guide

Hey! Let me explain how I use the My Leagues tab as a tennis player. It's actually pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.

---

## **Getting Started**

When I first click on **"My Leagues"** in my dashboard, I see all the leagues I've joined. Think of it like my tennis competition hub - everything league-related happens here.

---

## **The Main Screen**

### **My Active Leagues**

I see cards for each league I'm in. For example, if I joined the "Spring Tournament 2024", I'll see a card that shows:
- The league name
- A green badge saying "In Progress" (or gray if it's finished)
- What season it is
- A big **"View League"** button

If I haven't joined any leagues yet, I just see a message saying "No Active Leagues" with a button to browse available leagues.

### **Checking My History**

There's a button at the top that says **"View History"**. When I click it, I can see all the leagues I've played in before - kind of like looking at my tennis resume. It's cool to see how I've done over time.

---

## **Diving Into a League**

When I click **"View League"** on any of my league cards, it opens up a detailed view with **4 tabs**. This is where all the action happens:

---

## **TAB 1: My Matches** 📅

This is where I see all my tennis matches for this league.

### **What I See:**

**Upcoming Matches:**
- Shows who I'm playing against
- When and where the match is
- Has a blue icon and says "Upcoming"
- There's a **"Schedule Match"** button if I need to reschedule

**Completed Matches:**
- Shows matches I've already played
- Green background if I won (with a trophy icon 🏆)
- Red background if I lost
- Shows the final score like "6-4, 7-5"
- If I won but haven't reported the score yet, there's a **"Report Score"** button

**Example:**
```
🏆 vs Mike Johnson - Victory
Dec 18, 2024 • 7:00 PM • Court 3
Final Score: 6-4, 7-5
```

If there's an active tournament going on, I see a cool green banner at the top with a pulsing dot that says "Active Tournament" - makes it feel exciting!

---

## **TAB 2: Division Standings** 📊

This is basically the leaderboard for my division. It shows where I rank compared to the other players in my group.

### **What I See:**

A list of all players in my division, ranked from 1st to last. Each person shows:
- Their rank number (top 3 get a trophy emoji 🏆)
- Their name
- Their record (like "12W - 4L")
- Their win percentage
- Total points
- Whether they're "Playoff Ready" or how many more matches they need

**My Row:**
- My row is highlighted in blue so I can find myself quickly
- It has a little "You" badge
- Shows my current rank

**The Cool Part:**
Next to each opponent's name, there's a **"Schedule"** button. When I click it, it takes me to their calendar so I can see when they're available to play. Super convenient!

**Example:**
```
🏆 1. Sarah Chen - 15W-2L • 75% Win Rate • 45 pts • Playoff Ready
   2. Mike Johnson - 14W-3L • 82% Win Rate • 42 pts • Playoff Ready
💙 3. You - 12W-4L • 75% Win Rate • 36 pts • Playoff Ready [Schedule buttons next to others]
```

---

## **TAB 3: League Standings** 🏆

This tab will eventually show how I rank against players from ALL divisions in the league, not just mine. Right now it says "Coming Soon" because the feature is still being built. It'll be cool to see where I stand league-wide!

---

## **TAB 4: Playoff Bracket** 🥇

This is where the tournament bracket will show up once we get to playoffs. Right now it says "Available during playoffs" because we're still in the regular season. But once playoffs start, I'll be able to see:
- Who's playing who
- Semifinal matches
- The championship final
- Who won the whole thing

---

## **The Smart Stuff That Happens Behind the Scenes**

### **Automatic Updates**

When someone else reports a score or schedules a match, I don't need to refresh the page - it updates automatically! It's like magic but it's actually real-time technology.

### **Smart Grouping**

When I first joined the league, the system automatically put me in a division with players at my skill level. So I'm not playing against pros when I'm intermediate - everyone in my division is roughly the same level.

### **Points System**

Every time I win, I get 3 points. The more matches I play and win, the higher I climb. The system calculates everything automatically - I just play tennis and watch my rank go up!

---

## **What I Love About It**

✅ **Everything in One Place**: All my league info, matches, and opponents  
✅ **Easy Scheduling**: One click to see when opponents are free  
✅ **Real-Time Updates**: No refreshing needed  
✅ **Clear Rankings**: Always know where I stand  
✅ **Playoff Tracking**: Can see if I'm on track for playoffs  
✅ **Match History**: Can look back at all my games

## **Quick Tips**

💡 **Check standings regularly** - See who you need to beat to move up  
💡 **Schedule early** - Good time slots fill up fast  
💡 **Report scores promptly** - Keeps the leaderboard accurate

- **Schedule Button** = Easy way to book matches with opponents

It's basically everything I need to compete in organized tennis leagues without the hassle of managing spreadsheets, group chats, or email chains. Just play tennis, report scores, and watch my progress! 🎾

# Notification Sound File
# This is a placeholder. You can replace this with an actual MP3 file.
# The app will fall back to a generated beep sound if this file is not found.
# 
# To add a custom sound:
# 1. Find or create a short notification sound (0.3-0.5 seconds recommended)
# 2. Convert it to MP3 format
# 3. Replace this file with: notification-sound.mp3
